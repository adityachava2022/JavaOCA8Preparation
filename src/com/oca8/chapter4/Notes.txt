* In between the access modifier and return type , there can be final/static methods.
Ex:
public final void nap(int minutes) throws InterruptedException {
// take a nap
}
method body

*an identifi er may only contain letters, numbers, $, or _.
Also, the fi rst character is not allowed to be a number, and reserved words are not allowed.
By convention, methods begin with a lowercase letter but are not required to.

*A method can use vararguments like an array. But it should only be in the last argument, i.e only one
per method.

ex: 
public void walk1(int... nums) { }
public void walk2(int start, int... nums) { }
public void walk3(int... nums, int start) { } // DOES NOT COMPILE
public void walk4(int... start, int... nums) { } // DOES NOT COMPILE

*for Var args:
 - > You can pass in an array, 
 - > you can list the elements of the array and let Java create it for you. 
 - > You can even omit the vararg values in the method call and Java will create an array of length zero for you.
 
*Access Modifiers:
¦ private: Only accessible within the same class
¦ default (package private) access: private and other classes in the same package
¦ protected: default access and child classes
¦ public: protected and classes in the other packages


*For protected access modifier :
	- > A member is used without referring to a variable, protected access is allowed.
	- > A member is used through a variable. If it is a subclass, protected access is allowed. This works for references to the same class or a
subclass.

Static  :
---------
*Static methods don’t require an instance of the class. They are shared among all users of the class.
* Static members are accessed by using a 'class name.member'.
Note: You can use an instance of the object to call a static method. The compiler checks for the type of the reference and
uses that instead of the object

Static vs Instance :
--------------------
* Static members cannot call the non-static methods of the class.

Scenarios :

* Static method calling Another static method or variable         ->         Using the classname
* Static method calling An instance method or variable			  ->		 Not possible
* Instance method calling A static method or variable			  ->		 Using the classname or a reference variable
* Instance method calling An instance method or variable		  ->		 Using a reference variable


* static initializers:
----------------------
* The static initializer runs when the class is first used.The statements in it run
and assign any static variables as needed.
* Static final variables should be atleast intialized in the static initialization blocks.
There is a common case to use a static initializer: when you need to initialize a
static fi eld and the code to do so requires more than one line. This often occurs
when you want to initialize a collection like an ArrayList. When you do need to
use a static initializer, put all the static initialization in the same block.

static Imports:
---------------
* Static imports are for importing static members of classes like methods and variables.
* Note that if there is a method we implemented with (the name that was imported) is implemented in the class, then the 
the implemented method would take precedence.
* Importing static members with the same name will not compile.
