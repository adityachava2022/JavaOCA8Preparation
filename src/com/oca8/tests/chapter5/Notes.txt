* The instance method cannot override a parent's static method.
* Variables are always hidden regardless of the access modifier
* A reference to an object requires an explicit cast if referenced
with a subclass.
* a superclass may have already implemented an inherited interface, so the
concrete subclass would not need to implement the method
* we can override a default method in an interface provided it
will satisfy the overriden rules.
* in abstract class , you can call a main method.
